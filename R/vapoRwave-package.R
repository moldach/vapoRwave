#' vapoRwave: Add a vaporwave theme to ggplot2
#' @description
#' Giving a bit of 80's flair to ggplot2
#'
#' Vaporwave is an electronic music microgenre from the early 2010s.
#' Its stylistic influences include chillwave, smooth jazz, chopped and screwed,
#' new-age, and pop. To explain it in words kind of ruins the point.
#' Vaporwave is the muzak that plays in an elevator in a mall in a
#' futuristic Japanese cyberpunk dystopia. It’s the music sedated
#' freaks listen to on the neo-dance floor. It’s the jams your funky
#' smartphone mediates to when it’s running low on power and is cool
#' with it. It’s a word that can’t be shouted, only coolly whispered.
#' Vaporwave isn’t vaporware, it’s real.
#'
#' Vaporwave isn’t just something you listen to either, it’s something you
#' experience, and experiences include visuals. Vaporwave visual art,
#' simply referred to as “aesthetics,” is varied but tends to honor some
#' core tenets. If you’re looking at something pink and teal with a marble
#' classical bust and a glitchy Windows 95 logo, you’re probably looking at
#' a vaporwave aesthetic
