\description{
Giving a bit of 80's flair to ggplot2

Vaporwave is an electronic music microgenre from the early 2010s.
Its stylistic influences include chillwave, smooth jazz, chopped and screwed,
new-age, and pop. To explain it in words kind of ruins the point.
Vaporwave is the muzak that plays in an elevator in a mall in a
futuristic Japanese cyberpunk dystopia. It’s the music sedated
freaks listen to on the neo-dance floor. It’s the jams your funky
smartphone mediates to when it’s running low on power and is cool
with it. It’s a word that can’t be shouted, only coolly whispered.
Vaporwave isn’t vaporware, it’s real.

Vaporwave isn’t just something you listen to either, it’s something you
experience, and experiences include visuals. Vaporwave visual art,
simply referred to as “aesthetics,” is varied but tends to honor some
core tenets. If you’re looking at something pink and teal with a marble
classical bust and a glitchy Windows 95 logo, you’re probably looking at
a vaporwave aesthetic
